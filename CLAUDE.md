## Project Overview

YBase is an open-source budget management application for German non-profit associations. It provides budget tracking, reimbursement workflows, and CSV import from German banks (Sparkasse, Volksbank, Moss).

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev                     # Start Next.js dev server with turbopack
pnpm build                   # Production build
pnpm lint                    # Biome linting
pnpm lint:fix                # Biome linting with auto-fix
pnpm format                  # Prettier formatting
pnpm test                    # Unit/integration tests (Vitest)
pnpm test:e2e                # E2E tests (Playwright)
pnpm test:all                # Run Vitest and Playwright
pnpm coverage                # Tests with coverage report
```

**Run a single test file:**

```bash
pnpm vitest run app/lib/server/projects/projects.test.ts
pnpm exec playwright test e2e/reimbursements.spec.ts
```

## Architecture

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + MongoDB + Auth.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

**Route Structure:**

- `app/(protected)/` - Authenticated routes (dashboard, projects, transactions, reimbursements)
- `app/(public)/` - Public routes (login, shareable forms)

**Backend:**

- `app/lib/db/` - MongoDB client, collections, indexes, and shared database types
- `app/lib/server/` - Server-only data access and domain actions grouped by feature
- `app/lib/auth/` - Auth.js configuration and authorization helpers
- Protected reads and writes are scoped by `organizationId` for multi-tenant data isolation

**Path Alias:** `@/` → `app/`

## Key Domain Concepts

**Transaction Status:**

- `processed` - Bank transactions that count toward project balance
- `expected` - Planned transactions that do NOT count toward balance

**Transaction Types:**

- Regular transactions (imported or manual)
- Split transactions (`splitFromTransactionId`) - income split across projects, counted as processed
- Transfer transactions (`transferId`) - internal budget moves, counted toward balance

**Tax Spheres (German non-profit categories):**

- `non-profit` (Ideeller Bereich)
- `asset-management` (Vermögensverwaltung)
- `purpose-operations` (Zweckbetrieb)
- `commercial-operations` (Wirtschaftlicher Geschäftsbetrieb)

**Authorization:** `admin` is the only manually assigned elevated role and has
full access. All other permissions come from organigram lead assignments.

Team leads manage job postings and applications of the teams they actually lead
(`isTeamLead` / `isSecondaryTeamLead`). Leads in People & Culture additionally
manage publishing, members, and organization structure. Leads in Finance &
Legal manage finance workflows.

## Testing

- Use Vitest for unit/integration tests and Playwright for E2E flows; MongoDB integration tests use `mongodb-memory-server`
- Add tests for meaningful observable behavior, concrete regressions, and high-risk boundaries such as money, permissions, tenant isolation, destructive actions, and external integrations
- Do not add tests merely because code changed; skip styling, copy, trivial wiring, implementation details, and refactors without behavior changes
- Test at the lowest stable layer without duplicating coverage, and run the narrowest relevant test locally

## Documentation

- `docs/schema.md` - Database ER diagram
- `docs/Security.md` - Security implementation
- `docs/ThreatModel.md` - Threat analysis
- `docs/exampleTransactions.csv` - Test data for CSV import

## Code Style

**Before making any changes:** Do not make changes until you have 95% confidence that you know what to build. Ask follow-up questions until you have that confidence.

**Priority order when working on code:**

1. Fix all errors first
2. Simplify components as much as possible
3. Remove unnecessary code

**Principles:**

- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Remove code, don't add code
- No nested code blocks
- No complex syntax
- Flat is better than nested

**Naming:**

- No single-letter variable names except:
  - `e` for events
  - `q` for queries
  - `t` for test contexts

**Readability:**

- Write code that reads like plain English
- Early returns over nested conditionals
- Extract complex conditions into named variables
- Prefer simple loops over chained array methods when clearer

## Git Commits

- NEVER add Co-Authored-By lines
- NEVER add Claude as co-author
- Keep commit messages short and natural language
- Examples: "added new index for transaction query", "fixed user permissions bug", "removed unused imports"
