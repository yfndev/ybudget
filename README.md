# YBudget 💰

> Open-source budget management for german associations.

YBudget helps german (non profit) associations manage their budgets when Excel gets too complicated. It is built by [Joël Heil Escobar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-heil-escobar) as a [CODE University](https://code.berlin/) Capstone project. The initial idea came when the [Young Founders Network e.V.](https://youngfounders.network) got into desperate need of such a solution.

**The problem?**
Most budget tools are too expensive or too complex for associations to use. While Excel is flexible, it is also plenty of work keeping track of all the expenses that go in and out.

**Our solution?**
Simple, affordable, intuitive and open-source.

## Architecture

YBudget uses Next.js 15 App Router with protected and public routes:

- `app/(public)/` → Login and public pages
- `app/(protected)/` → Authenticated dashboard with sidebar navigation

Data flows through Convex for real-time sync. Every query is scoped by `organizationId` for data isolation.

## Self-Hosting

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, pnpm, [Convex account](https://www.convex.dev/)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ybudget.git
cd ybudget
pnpm install
npx convex dev  # Creates .env.local with CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT and NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL
```

### 2. Generate JWT Keys

Run this script and copy the output:

```bash
node -e "
const { generateKeyPair, exportPKCS8, exportJWK } = require('jose');
(async () => {
  const keys = await generateKeyPair('RS256', { extractable: true });
  const privateKey = await exportPKCS8(keys.privateKey);
  const publicKey = await exportJWK(keys.publicKey);
  console.log('JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=\"' + privateKey.trimEnd().replace(/\n/g, ' ') + '\"');
  console.log('JWKS=' + JSON.stringify({ keys: [{ use: 'sig', ...publicKey }] }));
})();
"
```

### 3. Set Up Google OAuth

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application)
3. Add authorized redirect URI: `https://<your-convex-deployment>.convex.site/api/auth/callback/google`
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Set in Convex Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables, or via CLI:

```bash
npx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_ID "your-google-client-id"
npx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET "your-google-client-secret"
npx convex env set JWT_PRIVATE_KEY "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- ..."
npx convex env set JWKS '{"keys":[...]}'
npx convex env set SITE_URL "http://localhost:3000"

# Optional
npx convex env set RESEND_API_KEY "re_..."
npx convex env set STRIPE_KEY "sk_test_..."
npx convex env set STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_SECRET "whsec_..."
```

### 5. Run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 6. Deploy

```bash
npx convex deploy
npx vercel
```

Update `SITE_URL` to your production URL after deploying.

## Testing

Through using vitest, the project got a 100% test coverage on lines, functions and ~96% on branch for unit and integration tests.

```bash
pnpm vitest run              # Unit & integration tests
pnpm vitest run --coverage   # Get test coverage report
pnpm exec playwright test    # E2E tests
```

GitHub Actions runs both test suites on every push and PR.

## Security

OAuth 2.0, role-based access control, organizational data isolation, encrypted at rest.
