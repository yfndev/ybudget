# YBudget

> Open-source budget management for German associations.

YBudget helps German (non-profit) associations manage their budgets when Excel gets too complicated. Built by [Joël Heil Escobar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-heil-escobar) as a [CODE University](https://code.berlin/) Capstone project. The initial idea came when [Young Founders Network e.V.](https://youngfounders.network) needed such a solution.

**The problem?**
Most budget tools are too expensive or too complex for associations. Excel is flexible but keeping track of all expenses is plenty of work.

**Our solution?**
Simple, affordable, intuitive, and open-source.

## Features

- **Dashboard & Charts:** Visualize cashflow with income, expenses, and balance trends
- **Transaction Import:** Import CSV from Sparkasse, Volksbank, & Moss
- **Budget Transfers:** Move budgets between projects when plans change

## Architecture

YBudget uses Next.js 15 App Router with protected and public routes:

- `app/(public)/` → Login and public pages
- `app/(protected)/` → Authenticated dashboard with sidebar navigation

Data flows through Convex for real-time sync. Every query is scoped by `organizationId` for data isolation.

### Money handling logic 💸

Transactions are categorized by status for budget calculations:

- **Processed**: Imported bank transactions. Count towards project balance (Kontostand).
- **Expected**: Planned transactions. Do NOT count towards balance and are shown separately as expected income/expenses.
- **Split**: Portions of income split across projects. Treated as processed and therefore count towards balance.
- **Transfer**: Internal budget moves between projects and also count towards balance.

## Self-Hosting

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, pnpm, [Convex account](https://www.convex.dev/)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joelheile/ybudget.git
cd ybudget
pnpm install
npx convex dev  # Creates .env.local with CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT and NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL
```

### 2. Initialize Auth

```bash
npx @convex-dev/auth
```

### 3. Set Up Google OAuth

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application)
3. Add authorized redirect URI: `https://<your-convex-deployment>.convex.site/api/auth/callback/google`
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Set in Convex Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables or via CLI:

```bash
npx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_ID "your-google-client-id"
npx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET "your-google-client-secret"

# Optional
npx convex env set OPENAI_API_KEY "sk_proj_"
npx convex env set RESEND_API_KEY "re_..."
npx convex env set STRIPE_KEY "sk_test_..."
npx convex env set STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_SECRET "whsec_..."
```

### 5. Run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Test CSV functionality with the [example file](docs/exampleTransactions.csv).

### 6. Deploy

```bash
npx convex deploy
npx vercel
```

Update `SITE_URL` to your production URL after deploying.
