# YBudget 💰

> Open-source budget management for german associations.

YBudget helps german (non profit) associations manage their budgets when Excel gets too complicated. It is built by [Joël Heil Escobar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-heil-escobar) as a [CODE University](https://code.berlin/) Capstone project. The initial idea came when the [Young Founders Network e.V.](https://youngfounders.network) got into desperate need of such a solution.

**The problem?**
Most budget tools are too expensive or too complex for associations to use. While Excel is flexible, it is also plenty of work keeping track of all the expenses that go in and out.

**Our solution?**
Simple, affordable, intuitive and open-source.

## Features

- 📊 **Budget Planning:** Organize projects by donors and already mark expected income and expenses
- 💳 **Transaction Import:** Import CSV from Sparkasse, Volksbank, & Moss and use smart matching to match expected expenses with the actual bank ones
- 🎯 **Project Organization:** Assign expenses to projects, see remaining budgets at a glance

## Self-Hosting

YBudget is fully self-hostable. Connect it to your own Convex backend and deploy it on your favorite platform (We use Vercel).

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, pnpm, [Convex account](https://www.convex.dev/) (free tier available)

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ybudget.git
cd ybudget
pnpm install

# Set up Convex
npx convex dev

# Configure environment variables
cp env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Convex URLs
# Set google auth & stripe variables in Convex Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables

# Run locally
pnpm dev


npx vercel          # Deploy Next.js
npx convex deploy   # Deploy Convex functions
```

## Security

We take security seriously at YBudget. Here's how we protect your financial data and keep operations safe for NGOs.

#### Authentication & Authorization

**1. OAuth instead of Password**

- We use OAuth 2.0 with Google instead of traditional username/password authentication
- This eliminates frequent password vulnerabilities (weak passwords or password reuse by user)
- It's implemented with [Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) → Google Provider in `convex/auth.ts`

**2. Organizational Isolation**

- Every database query is filtered by `organizationId` to make sure that data is seperated between organizations
- Organizations can only access their own transactions, projects, donors, and financial data
- All queries use indexed filters similar to `.withIndex("by_organization", (q) => q.eq("organizationId", user.organizationId))`

**3. Role-Based Access Control**

- Implemented permission levels, after talking to first potential customers
- `member` (read-only) → `lead` (can edit and manage teams) → `admin` (full control over users, projects, etc.)
- Functions check minimum required roles before executing sensitive operations
- `requireRole(ctx, "admin")` validates permissions through `convex/users/permissions.ts`

#### Data Protection

**4. Credentials & Secrets**

- All credentials (OAuth secrets, Stripe keys, JWT keys, etc.) are stored server side in Convex Dashboard
- Client never receives API keys or secrets, so that only public keys are exposed to browsers

**5. HTTPS Enforcement**

- All production traffic is encrypted using TLS, enforced by Convex Hosting and Next.js
- This protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and stops people from eavesdropping on financial data

**6. Encryption at Rest**

- Database is hosted on Convex Cloud which encrypts all data
- Backups are automatically encrypted and isolated per organization

**7. Auth JWT token security**

- Convex Auth signs JWT tokens with private keys so that only our backend can access
- Sessions expire automatically and users need to re-authenticate after some time
- Tokens are stored using httpOnly cookies with SameSite=Strict

### API Security

**8. Input Validation**

- Every function argument is validated at runtime using Convex validators
- This prevents malformed data from entering the system and makes sure that the data is correct

**9. Type-Safe Database Operations**

- Convex uses type-safe queries to prevent NoSQL injection attacks
- All database operations use typed query methods, not string concatenation

**10. Internal vs Public Functions**

- We separate sensitive operations (like payment fulfillment, user management) into internal functions
- These internal functions can only be called from our backend (not from client code)

#### Third Party Integrations

**11. Stripe Webhook Verification**

- Every Stripe webhook is verified before we process it using `STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_SECRET`
- Webhooks are signed using a shared secret

**12. Secure Payment Processing**

- We don't store any credit card data, as we can rely on Stripe as market leader for that
- Subscriptions are managed through Stripe's customer portal and only the subscriptionId and customerId is saved in our database

### Attack Prevention

**13. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers restrict which resources can be loaded
- React automatically escapes user input when rendering
- We don't use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or eval anywhere in the codebase

**14. Rate Limiting**

- Convex provides built in rate limiting on queries and mutations
- Prevents brute force attacks on login and API endpoints

**15. Secure Deployment Architecture**

- Frontend deployed on Vercel: automatic HTTPS, DDoS protection, CDN caching
- Backend functions run on Convex Cloud: managed security patches, automated encrypted backups
