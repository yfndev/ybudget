# YBudget 💰

> Open-source budget management for german associations.

YBudget helps german (non profit) associations manage their budgets when managing them in Excel gets too complicated. It was built by [Joël Heil Escobar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-heil-escobar) as a capstone project at [CODE University](https://code.berlin/) as his co-founded organization, the [Young Founders Network e.V.](https://youngfounders.network) was in desperate need for such a solution.

**The problem?**
Most budget tools are too expensive or too complex for associations to use.

**Our solution?**
Simple, affordable, and open-source.

## Features

- 📊 **Budget Planning:** Organize projects by donors and already mark expected income and expenses
- 💳 **Transaction Import:** Import CSV from Sparkasse, Volksbank, & Moss and use smart matching to match expected expenses with the actual bank ones
- 🎯 **Project Organization:** Assign expenses to projects, see remaining budgets at a glance

## Self-Hosting

YBudget is fully self-hostable. Connect it to your own Convex backend and deploy it on your favorite platform (I used Vercel).

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, pnpm, [Convex account](https://www.convex.dev/) (free tier available)

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ybudget.git
cd ybudget
pnpm install

# Set up Convex
npx convex dev

# Configure environment variables
cp env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Convex URLs
# Set google auth & stripe variables in Convex Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables

# Run locally
pnpm dev
```

**Environment Variables:**

- See `env.example` for required variables
- Set `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` in `.env.local`
- Set `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `SITE_URL`, and optional Stripe keys in Convex Dashboard

**Deploy:**

```bash
npx vercel          # Deploy Next.js
npx convex deploy   # Deploy Convex functions
```

## Security

We take security seriously at YBudget. Here's how we protect your financial data and keep operations safe for NGOs.

#### Authentication & Authorization

**1. OAuth instead of Password**

- We use OAuth 2.0 with Google instead of traditional username/password authentication
- Eliminates frequent password vulnerabilities (weak passwords or password reuse by user)
- Implemented with [Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) → Google Provider in `convex/auth.ts`

**2. Organizational Isolation**

- Every database query is filtered by `organizationId` to make sure that data is seperated between organizations
- Organizations can only access their own transactions, projects, donors, and financial data
- All queries use indexed filters similar to `.withIndex("by_organization", (q) => q.eq("organizationId", user.organizationId))`

**3. Role-Based Access Control**

- Implemented permission levels, after talking to first potential customers
- `member` (read-only) → `lead` (can edit) → `admin` (full control over users, projects, etc.)
- Functions check minimum required roles before executing sensitive operations
- `requireRole(ctx, "admin")` validates permissions through `convex/users/permissions.ts`

#### Data Protection

**4. Credentials & Secrets**

- All credentials (OAuth secrets, Stripe keys, JWT keys, etc.) are stored server side in Convex Dashboard
- Client never receives API keys or secrets, so that only public keys are exposed to browsers

**5. HTTPS Enforcement**

- All production traffic is encrypted using TLS, enforced by Convex Hosting and Next.js
- This protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and stops people from eavesdropping on financial data

**6. Encryption at Rest**

- Database is hosted on Convex Cloud which encrypts all data
- Backups are automatically encrypted and isolated per organization

**7. Auth JWT token security**

- Convex Auth signs JWT tokens with private keys only our backend can access
- Sessions expire automatically and users need to re-authenticate after some time
- Tokens are stored using httpOnly cookies with SameSite=Strict

### API Security

**8. Input Validation**

- Every function argument is validated at runtime using Convex validators, so that we can make sure that the data is correct
- This prevents malformed data from entering the system

**9. Type-Safe Database Operations**

- Convex uses type-safe queries to prevent NoSQL injection attacks
- All database operations use typed query methods, not string concatenation

**10. Internal vs Public Functions**

- We separate sensitive operations (like payment fulfillment, user management) into internal functions
- These internal functions can only be called from our backend (not from client code)

#### Third Party Integration Security

**11. Stripe Webhook Verification**

- Every Stripe webhook is verified before we process it using `STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_SECRET`
- Webhooks are signed with HMAC-SHA256 using a shared secret

**12. Secure Payment Processing**

- We don't store any credit card data, as we can rely on Stripe as market leader for that
- Subscriptions are managed through Stripe's customer portal and only the subscriptionId and customerId is saved in our database

### Attack Prevention

**13. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

- Content Security Policy headers restrict which resources can be loaded
- React automatically escapes user input when rendering
- We don't use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or eval anywhere in the codebase

**14. Rate Limiting**

- Convex provides built-in rate limiting on queries and mutations
- Prevents brute force attacks on login and API endpoints

### Production Deployment

**15. Secure Deployment Architecture**

- Frontend deployed on Vercel: automatic HTTPS, DDoS protection, CDN caching
- Backend functions run on Convex Cloud: managed security patches, automated encrypted backups
- Organization data isolated by `organizationId` at query level - even Convex support can't access customer data
