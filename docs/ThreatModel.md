## Data Flow Diagram

I've mapped out YBudget's security architecture using a Level 1 Data Flow Diagram to visualize how data moves through the system and where the critical trust boundaries are between services.

**What are trust boundaries?**
Trust boundaries highlight the points where data crosses between zones with different security levels. When data moves across these boundaries, it needs protection in form of validating and authenticating the data before it enters zones with a higher trust, and encrypting before going out to less trusted areas.

### Our Trust Zones

I've organized YBudget into five security zones, each with different trust levels and protection mechanisms.

**Public Zone (Untrusted)**

User browsers and devices are here as I can't control if the device is compromised. I therefore treat all input as potentially hostile and validate everything before it enters the system.

**External/Third party Services (Untrusted)**

Google OAuth, Stripe, Resend, and Posthog are trusted partners, but I can't control their closed source code. I protect these integrations with API key protection, webhook signature verification, and TLS encryption.

**Frontend Zone (Semi-Trusted)**

My Next.js application runs on Vercel (Deployment infrastructure) and in user browsers. It's my code, but in environments I don't fully control. I therefore enforce client side validation, Content Security Policy headers, and HTTPS to keep things secure.

**Backend Zone (Trusted)**

The Convex backend is where our business logic (queries & mutations) lives in a fully controlled environment. Every request goes through authentication and authorization checks (role based and organization scoped).

**Data Zone (Most Trusted)**

The database is the single source of truth and gets the highest level of protection. Organization scoped queries, type-safe operations and logging in Convex keep it secure.

## Trust Boundary Analysis using STRIDE

I analyzed each trust boundary using the **STRIDE** framework, which was developed by Microsoft to identify YBudget's security strengths and weaknesses.

- **Spoofing:** Pretending to be someone else → Fake login, forged webhook (mitigated through OAuth, JWT verification, webhook signatures)
- **Tampering:** Unauthorized data modification → Changing transaction amounts (Input validation, type-safe queries, digital signatures)
- o**Repudiation:** Denying you did something → "I didn't delete that project" (Audit logs with user ID and timestamps)
- **Information Disclosure:** Leaking sensitive data → Other org's data exposed, API keys in logs (Encryption, organization scoping, secrets management)
- **Denial of Service:** Making system unavailable → DDoS attack, resource exhaustion → Rate limiting, CDN protection
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Gaining unauthorized permissions → Member accessing admin functions (Role checks on every request (requireRole())

**Security issues I fixed while doing the STRIDE Analysis**
(and therefore aren't in weaknesses column anymore):

- implemented CSP header to prevent cross site scripting attacks
- limited CSV upload to only upload CSV files (confirmed that React & Papa Parse Library limit scripting )
- implemented organization based access control
- added audit logging for key operations (reimbursements, etc.)

## Architecture & Dependencies

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (server and client components for security, XSS protection)
- **Backend**: Convex (handles database encryption, queries/mutations and infrastructure)
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0 user verification implemented with Convex Auth → no passwords stored
  → Convex Auth also handles session management, JWT tokens, HTTPOnly cookies
- **Payment**: Stripe (handles payment compliance)
- **Email**: Resend (for user invitations, API keys stored server-side)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (CDN security, DDoS protection, TLS 1.3 enforcement ) + Convex Cloud (at rest encryption and managed backups)

This analysis focuses on what I can control at the application level. I'm explicitly not covering:

- **Physical security:** As data center security is handled by cloud providers
- **Cloud provider internals:** I trust Convex, Vercel, and Stripe to secure their infrastructure
- **End-user devices:** I can't control if someone's laptop has malware or their browser is outdated
- **Network infrastructure:** ISP security, routing, and network-level DDoS are outside my control
